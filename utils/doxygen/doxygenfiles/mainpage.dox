 *
 * eProsima RPC is a service invocation framework that enables to build distributed applications with minimal effort
 * using the client/server paradigm. It makes transparent the remote procedure call to developer without the programmer
 * explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction and allows developers to focus his efforts on their application logic.
 *
 * eProsima RPC provides an easy way to invoke remote procedures using DDS standard as communication middleware.
 * DDS (Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems) is an OMG specification of a data centric publish/subscribe
 * communication model among real time software applications. RPCDDS comes with all benefits that DDS standard provides
 * as reliable and efficient communications for distributed real time systems.
 *
 * eProsima RPC also brings other features:
 *
 * @li Synchronous, asynchronous and one-way invocations. The synchronous invocation is the common invocation
 * and it blocks the client’s thread until the reply is received from the server. The asynchronous invocation
 * sends the request to the server but it doesn’t blocks the client’s thread. In the asynchronous invocation the developer
 * provides a callback object that will be invoked when the reply is received from the server. The one-way invocation
 * is a fire-and-forget invocation where the client does not care about the success or failure of the invocation.
 * The one-way invocation does not expect any reply from the server.
 * @li eProsima RPC provides several strategies for the server. These strategies define how the server acts when a new request is received.
 * Current supported strategies are: single-thread strategy, thread-pool strategy and thread-per-request strategy.
 * Single-thread strategy uses one thread for all incoming requests. Thread-pool strategy uses thread-pool’s threads
 * to process the incoming requests. Thread-per-request strategy creates a new thread for each new incoming request
 * and this new thread will process the request.
 * @li eProsima RPC supports several transports that DDS will use in the communications. There are two available transports.
 * An UDP transport that brings the powerful benefit of DDS discovery in a local network or a TCP transport
 * that allows connections with public servers located in internet.
 * @li For DDS developers, eProsima RPC allows enhancing DDS with client/service communications.
 * A developer that uses DDS in its distributed application will be able to use a service-oriented interaction too.
